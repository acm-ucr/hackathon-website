# React Virtual

#### 28th Febuary 2024 by Divyank Shah

## Why React Virtual?

[React Virtual](https://tanstack.com/virtual/latest) is an headless UI for virtualizing large lists and is apart of the larger [Tanstack](https://tanstack.com) ecosystem.
Headless UI allows developers to fully customize the styles while maintaing the core logic allowing for performant and efficent web components.

Hackathons faced a bottleneck when users would register and need to select their current school. To ensure [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io) registration compliance, a total of [2225 schools](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/schools.csv)
must be available for users to select from. Rendering a list of 2225 items, where users can scroll, search, and select from seemed to be an easy task, where a developer can iterate through the schools to render them and have `onClick` event handlers
to store the paricular school a user selects. For search, a simple `useState` hook that would filter the list of 2225 items and the functionality is complete. However, this has drastic performance issues.

## Rendering Too Many items

At any given time, the user would only be able to view 5-8 items at a time, ALL 2225 were being rendered, they were just not visible. Checking the rendered content, it was very easy to spot the bottleneck.

The user did not at any point see all 2225 schools at the same time, and rendering them all was deemed pointless. A solution was needed such that only the currently visible schools were being rendered,
reducing the total number of rendered elements from 2225 to 5-8. As a result, the browser would have a much easier time working with rendering, scrolling, searching, and filtering.

## The Solution

React Virtual accomplishes exactly what we needed: virtualize a long list of 2225 schools and only render the visible elements.
Using the provided `useVirtualizer` API, it was simple to integrate `react-virtual` into the existing codebase:

```js title="src/components/dynamic/Select.jsx"
const { getTotalSize, getVirtualItems, measureElement } = useVirtualizer({
  count: options.length,
  getScrollElement: () => ref.current,
  estimateSize: () => 50,
  measureElement: (el) => {
    if (el.innerText.length > 45) return 50;
    else return 35;
  },
});
```

The above specifies the config options allowing us to change the size of the rendered container based on particular parameters.
Most importantly, it gave access to `getVirtualItems` which would later be used to iterate through the rendered elements only.
Iterating through the items was as simple as calling `.map()` on `getVirtualItems`:

```js title="src/components/dynamic/Select.jsx"
getVirtualItems().map((virtualRow) => {
  const name = options[virtualRow.index];

  return (
    <div
      className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full hover:bg-hackathon-green-200 hover:cursor-pointer flex items-center px-2"
      key={virtualRow.index}
      data-index={virtualRow.index}
      ref={measureElement}
      onClick={() => {
        setUser({ ...user, [field]: name });
        setShow(false);
      }}
      style={{
        height: `${virtualRow.size}px`,
        transform: `translateY(${virtualRow.start}px)`,
      }}
    >
      {name}
    </div>
  );
});
```

Since `react-virtual` was implemented on a component level, it means that all pages utilizing `<Select />` will benefit from a virtualized list.
As a result, other select items, such as selecting major, age, and grade also benefit, however not as drastically as schools due to the sheer size of the
lists required to render all possible options.
