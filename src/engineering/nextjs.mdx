# Next.js

#### 13th March 2024 by Raidah Fairooz

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is a full stack [React](https://react.dev) framework built on top of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to provide a more optimized way of creating web applications. It supports fast performance and deployment, server side rendering and search engine optimization, amongst other features.

## Pre Next.js

`create-react-app` was used in the past in order to build react applications. However, the developer would run into the following challenges:

**Limited Application Scope:** CRA only supports Single Page Applications (SPA) i.e. once the application is loaded the user can interact with components without reloading the whole page. In addition, React Server Components (RSC) offloaded most of the work from client to server side. However, SPA is not ideal for building large, complex and scalable websites.

**Lots of Configuration:** CRA has very inflexible configuration and is entirely webpack based. To add any additional features, like routing, it required developers to install extra packages.

**Optimization:** Besides rendering techniques, CRA's pre-configured webpack does not automatically enhance performance for different types of components, like images.

## The Solution

`create-next-app` effectively solves the above challenges along with offering additional support. The key benefits are:

**Different Rendering Techniques**

Nextjs provides Server Side Rendering (SSR) out of the box. Without any additional configuration needed, all the pages are rendered on the server by default and the client side only displays html. This improves application loading times significantly and ensures better security. However, whenever needed, Nextjs allows the developer to switch between client and server side rendering and can utilize RSCs effectively.

Other techniques supported by Nextjs are Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR). SSG is ideal for cases where we need pages loading fast for users since it pre-renders the code at build time. ISR builds on SSG concepts but prevents re-rendering the entire site for only static content - again improving performance.

**Page Based Routing**

The `app` directory is used for nested routing where developers can add folders and files to create separate pages. It organizes the codebase and supports scalability for Multiple Page Applications (MPA).

**Full Stack Integration:**

Even though it is mostly a frontend tool, Nextjs supports integrating API routes for backend development through Express, facilitating the creation of a full stack application on a single framework.

**Better Configuration and Maintenance**

Pretty much everything can be customized in Nextjs. Starting from code formatting/styling to advanced server-side components, it allows developers to have control over the specific requirements of their applications.

**Optimized Performance:**

As mentioned in react optimization, images are common components that cause website loading delays. Nextjs has their own `Image` component with built in optimizations to ensure better format and compressed sizes.

**Fast Deployment:**

With support for platforms like Vercel, Nextjs applications are fast and easy to deploy - highly improving developer experience.
