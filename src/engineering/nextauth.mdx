# Next Auth

#### 6th March by Theo Fernandez

## Why Use Authentication?

Since a hackathon typically involves various roles (participants, mentors, judges, etc.), we needed a way to manage and differentiate large quantity of user data and permissions.

Authentication streamlines hackathon logistics by eliminating the need for unnecessary manual form checking and allowing for effective user management. We can keep track of users through their authentication session and automatically populate their specific role form submission into our database.

## What is Next Auth?

[Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) is an authentication library for Next.js applications. It provides a flexible API for authentication, and is designed to work with Next.js and any OAuth provider.

Unlike Auth services like Auth0 and Amazon Cognito, Next Auth allows us to own our data and full control over the authentication process. The current scale of our hackathon website is also not large enough to warrant the additional fees of external providers.

Hooking up Next Auth to GoogleProvider allows us to quickly log in users and maintain user sessions through secure cookies.

## User Authentication Workflow

Here is an example of our authentication in the ProtectedPage component. This component is our solution for redirecting any user who is not authenticated to the login page.

```js title="src/components/dynamic/ProtectedPage.jsx"
import { signIn, useSession } from "next-auth/react";

const ProtectedPage = ({ children, restrictions, title }) => {
  const { data: session, status } = useSession();
useEffect(() => {
    if (status === "loading") return;
    if (status !== "authenticated") {
      // redirect any users who are not authenticated to the login page
      void signIn("google");
      return;
    }
    setConfirmed(true);
	}, [status]);


}
return (
    <>
      {status === "loading" && <Loading />}
      {confirmed && (
        <>
        {... Render Page}
        <>
      )}

      )


```

## Authenticating API Routes Based on User Roles

Each API endpoint we call is authenticated by a verification of the user's role status. Each role can have a status of pending (0), denied (-1) or approved (1). Both a user's role and the role's status is verified in our `authenticate` function:

```js title="src/utils/auth.js"
import { getServerSession } from "next-auth/next";

export const authenticate = async (restrictions = {}) => {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);

  if (!session.user) {
    return { message: "Invalid Authentication Credentials.", auth: 401 };
  }

  const authorized = Object.entries(restrictions).some(([key, value]) =>
    value.includes(session.user.roles[key])
  );

  if (!authorized && Object.keys(restrictions).length > 0) {
    return { message: `Forbidden Access`, auth: 403 };
  }

  return {
    message: null,
    auth: 200,
    uid: session.user.id,
    user: session.user,
  };
};
```

The Next Auth getServerSession prop authenticates if the user has an active server side session. The "restrictions" prop lists what role status the user needs to access this specific API endpoint. For example, a user with an "admins" role with status [-1] or [0] cannot access admin functionality. Any users with a "participants" role with status [-1] were denied access to the hackathon and cannot access the participant dashboard. This is our solution for managing user permissions.
