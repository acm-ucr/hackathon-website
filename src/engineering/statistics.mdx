# Statistics

#### 7th July 2024 by Sean Quiambao

## What is the Statistics Page?

For every hackathon, we want to keep track of how many people signed up for our hackathons. This information is used to plan and gauge the scale of our hackathons. We also want to track how many attendees attended each workshop or event at our hackathons. The statistics page is a page in the admin dashboard keeping track of the number of users and attendees at a hackathon.

## How is Statistics implemented?

To understand how our hackathons keep track of the statistics, we must look into the forms API calls. When a user signs up at the forms page, the website makes a POST request at `/api/dashboard/[type]`. The word `[type]` utilizes Next.js's dynamic routing which consolidates all roles into one single API call.

In the POST request function of `/api/dashboard/[type]/route.js`, we call Firestore to update the docs called "statistics" and increment that role by 1.

```js title="src/app/api/dashboard/[type]/route.js"
    // ... Authentication and Error Handling
    try {
        // ... Adds users to the database
        await updateDoc(doc(db, "statistics", "statistics"), {
          [`${params.type}.0`]: increment(1),
        });
    }
```

User roles are not the only statistics we keep track of. We also keep track of the attendance for different events. Whenever the user attends an event, they must scan a QR code. Once they scan a valid QR code, the website makes a PUT request to the `/api/checkin` route.

In the PUT request function of `/api/checkin/route.js`, we make a Firestore query to check if an event exists. If the data does not exist (meaning the user is the first to attend an event), then we create an attendance for that event. Otherwise, we increment the attendance.

```js title="src/app/api/checkin/route.js"
    try {
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars
    const [_, data] = await Promise.all([
      updateDoc(doc(db, "users", uid), {
        events: arrayUnion(event),
      }),
      getDoc(doc(db, "events", event)),
    ]);

    if (data.exists()) {
      await updateDoc(doc(db, "events", event), {
        attendance: increment(1),
      });
    } else {
      await setDoc(doc(db, "events", event), {
        attendance: 1,
        name: name,
      });
    }
    }
```

After the website updates the statistics in Firebase through the forms page, the admins can see those statistics on the statistics page.

From here, we can make a GET request in `/api/statistics/route.js` to fetch the numbers from the `events` document.

```js title="src/app/api/statistics/route.js
// ... Authenticates user
try {
    const [statistics, events] = await Promise.all([
      getDoc(doc(db, "statistics", "statistics")),
      getDocs(collection(db, "events")),
    ]);

    const {
      teams: { 1: teams },
      participants: { 1: participants },
      volunteers: { 1: volunteers },
      judges: { 1: judges },
      mentors: { 1: mentors },
      committees: { 1: committees },
      sponsors: { 1: sponsors },
      panels: { 1: panels },
      admins: { 1: admins },
    } = statistics.data();

    const attendees = {};

    events.forEach((doc) => {
      const { name, attendance } = doc.data();
      attendees[name] = attendance;
    });

    const users = {
      participants,
      teams,
      judges,
      volunteers,
      mentors,
      committees,
      sponsors,
      panels,
      admins,
    };

    return res.json({ items: { users, events: attendees } }, { status: 200 });
```

After authenticating the user, the statistics page grabs the data from the statistics document from Firestore. `statistics.data()` returns all of the users who register. Still, we only want the users who have been accepted (i.e. `[type]: { 1: [type] }`).

Afterward, we go through each document in events and retrieve the number of attendees for each event. We return the data and display them on the statistics page.

## Old Statistics Page

The old statistics page displays the data as pie charts rather than numbers. We used the nivo package to draw the data into pie charts. We discontinued the pie chart because of the UI issues that are difficult to manage. There was not any backend implementation at the time, and we used sample data to display the demographics. We also did not implement statuses for each role around this time.
