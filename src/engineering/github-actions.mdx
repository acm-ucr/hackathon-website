# Github Actions

#### 22nd June 2024 by Andrew Khadder

## What are Github Actions?

Github Actions is Github's continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform. Having a CI/CD platform allows us to automate our building and testing pipelines on every commit.

## What is CI/CD?

Continuous integration and continuous deployment is a process that streamlines the software development cycle. It automatically and frequently integrates our code changes to our repository.
Everytime the code changes our CI/CD pipelines are run automatically to ensure a working state of our repository at all times.
It minimizes downtime and its automation allows quicker development cycles as it allows us to merge code in faster.

## How do we use it?

We use Actions to automate our build, testing, and formatting processes. This ensures that every PR will not break our production when it is merged.
We have workflows to check formatting and linting to ensure that our code stays uniform thorughout the codebase.
We also have a workflow that runs our entire build process. This build process is essential to ensure no one can merge in breaking changes.
After this build is complete our pipeline then runs both our component tests and our end-to-end tests automatically. If any of these Actions fail, the branch can not be merged.

Hackathon Website has two workflow files, one that runs on every pull request and one that syncs repositories created from its template.
The pull request workflow runs on every pull request and does the process explained above.
The sync workflow only runs on repositories created from its template. This workflow runs daily and ensures all changes from the template are automatically synced.

## Pull Requests

All Github Actions are created through workflows. These workflows are stored in `.github/workflows` and are written in YAML.
All actions must start with their name, and then when they want to run.
So our workflow starts by saying we only want to run it when a PR wants to be merged into either our main or dev branch.

```yaml
name: Hackathon Website

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, dev]
```

Then we have our jobs section which tells us what we actually want to do in our workflow. This workflow runs multiple jobs.
We can take our format job for example. We start by naming our job, in this case, `format`. We then give it a name that will show up on the actual Github page.
We tell it what system we want it to run on, in this case on the latest Ubuntu version.
Then we finally give it the steps it needs to take.
The first step is usally to checkout our repository into the system.
This is an action given to us by Github in order to ensure proper checkout of the repository.
We then run our own custom ACM formatting tool in order to check the formatting of the branch.
The linting step is almost exactly the same, but instead using our own custom linting action.

```yaml
jobs:
  format:
    name: formatting
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Use ACM Formatting
        uses: acm-ucr/formatting@v2
```

The next jobs that are run are our build and testing steps.
Our build step uses our custom build action to build our website and ensure that there are no errors.
After the website is built, we can run our end-to-end testing and component testing workflows.
These workflows use Cypress custom actions to run our tests headlessly and ensure that none of our changes caused major breaking changes.

```yaml
build:
  name: build
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Use ACM Build
      uses: acm-ucr/build@v2

    - name: Save build folder
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: build
        if-no-files-found: error
        path: ./.next

e2e_testing:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: build
  steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Download the build folder
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: build
        path: ./.next

    - name: Run Cypress
      uses: cypress-io/github-action@v6
      with:
        project: ./
        browser: chrome
        start: npm run start
        wait-on: "http://localhost:3000"

component_testing:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: build
  steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Download the build folder
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: build
        path: ./.next

    - name: Run Cypress
      uses: cypress-io/github-action@v6
      with:
        component: true
        project: ./
        browser: chrome
        start: npm run start
        wait-on: "http://localhost:3000"
```

## Sync Template

The Hackathon Website is meant to be used as a template for Hackathon organizations to use and theme for their respective events.
However, the template is constantly being worked on and Github does not have a way to pull changes directly from a template.
Because of this, we have written a workflow that automatically pulls changes from the template every day.

This workflow is different as it runs on a schedule. More specifically it will run at 6 AM every day.
This is to ensure that all repositories created from the template are constantly up to date.

```yaml
name: Sync Changes from Template
on:
  schedule:
    # Run at 6:00 AM every day
    - cron: "0 14 * * *"
```

We then have our syncing job. The first thing we need to check is that this workflow does not run on our template.
This is to avoid unnecessacary runs and workflow actions.

```yaml
jobs:
  sync-from-template:
    # don't run this job on the template
    if: github.repository != 'acm-ucr/hackathon-website'
    name: Sync changes from acm-ucr/hackathon-website
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

We then run our actual syncing process. Our syncing process works by opening a PR that will merge all our changes from the template into the current repository.
This process only automates the creating of the PR and won't automatically merge it due to merge conflicts that may arise.

The first step is to fetch all changes from our template. After this we check if a branch to sync our template already exists.
If it already exists then we switch to that branch and pull the changes from the template, automatically updating the open PR.
If the PR is closed, that means our branch does not exist and we have to create a new branch and PR that will sync the changes.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout Current Repo
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
    with:
      path: ${{ github.repository }}
      token: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW_TOKEN }}

  - name: Fetch all
    working-directory: ${{ github.repository }}
    run: |
      git remote add template https://github.com/acm-ucr/hackathon-website
      git fetch --all
  - name: Checkout and push Template Dev Branch
    working-directory: ${{ github.repository }}
    run: |
      branch_exists=$(git branch --list --remote | { grep -F "origin/sync-template" || true; } )
      if [ -z "$branch_exists" ]
      then
        git checkout -b sync-template template/dev
        git push origin sync-template
        gh pr create --base dev --head sync-template --title "Sync Template Changes" --body "Syncing template changes"
      else
        git checkout -b sync-template origin/sync-template
        git pull template dev
        git push
      fi
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW_TOKEN }}
```
