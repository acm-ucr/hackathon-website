# Team Creation + Joining

#### 14th July 2024 by Fuyuki Malahom

## What is Team Creation + Joining?

Team creation and joining are essential features in hackathons that allow participants to form groups and collaborate on projects. These features provide a platform for individuals to connect, share ideas, and work together towards a common goal. Effective team dynamics can significantly enhance the hackathon experience, making it more productive and enjoyable.

## How did we implement it?

When users press a button to create a team, a function will call an API:

```jsx
const handleCreate = () => {
  if (team.name === "") {
    toaster("Enter a Valid Team Name", "error");
    return;
  }
  api({
    method: "POST",
    url: "/api/team",
    body: { team: team },
  }).then(({ items }) => {
    setTeam(items);
    setUser({ ...user, team: items.id });
    toaster("Successfully created a new team!", "success");
    setEdit(false);
    setLoad(true);
  });
};
```

After the creation of a team in the database, users need to be able to join the team.

Let's take a look at what is going on in this Server Component called Join:

```jsx title="src\components\user\join\Join.jsx"
import { fetchTeam } from "@/actions/join";
import JoinClient from "@/components/user/join/JoinClient";

const Join = async ({ params }) => {
  const { teamID: id } = params;
  const team = await fetchTeam(id);

  return <div>{team && <JoinClient team={team} id={id} />}</div>;
};

export default Join;
```

The Server Component is making a database call called fetchTeam with an id and then passing that into a Client Component called JoinClient.

Here is the Database call:

```jsx
import { db } from "@/utils/firebase";
import { doc, getDoc } from "firebase/firestore";
import Fault from "@/utils/error";

export async function fetchTeam(id) {
  const docSnap = await getDoc(doc(db, "teams", id));
  if (docSnap.exists()) {
    return { id: docSnap.id, ...docSnap.data() };
  } else {
    throw new Fault(404, "Invalid Team ID", "Please get a new team invite");
  }
}
```

The team data retrieved from the database call is then passed into a Client Component called JoinClient:

```jsx
"use client";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
import { useSession } from "next-auth/react";
import Button from "@/components/Button";
import { api } from "@/utils/api";
import toaster from "@/utils/toaster";

const JoinClient = ({ team, id }) => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { update: sessionUpdate } = useSession();

  const handleJoin = async () => {
    const response = await api({
      method: "PUT",
      url: "/api/members",
      body: { team: id },
    });
    if (response.message !== "OK") {
      toaster(`${response.message}`, "error");
      return;
    }
    toaster("Successfully joined team!", "success");
    sessionUpdate({
      team: id,
    });
    router.push("/user");
  };

  return (
    <>
      {team && (
        <div className="flex h-screen w-screen flex-col items-center justify-center font-poppins">
          <p className="text-3xl">
            Are you sure you want to join{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">{team.name}</span>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-1 font-semibold">Members</p>
          {team.members.map((member, index) => (
            <p className="m-0 flex items-center pl-3" key={index}>
              {member.name}
              <span className="ml-3 text-sm text-hackathon-green-300">
                {member.email}
              </span>
            </p>
          ))}
          <Button color="green" size="xl" text="Join" onClick={handleJoin} />
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  );
};
```

By leveraging server-side rendering and efficient data fetching, we have optimized the process of joining a team. This ensures that participants have immediate access to the relevant team information, reducing wait times and enhancing the overall user experience.

As for joining a team, we have a function called handleJoin which will make an API call to allow the user to join a team with an id.

## How did we do it before? What was the new change?

In the past, we used a useEffect hook along with an API call to retrieve the team data:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (teamID) {
    api({
      method: "GET",
      url: `/api/team?teamid=${teamID}`,
    }).then((response) => {
      if (response.message === "OK") {
        setTeam(response.items);
      } else if (response.message === "Invalid Team ID") {
        throw new Fault(404, "Invalid Team ID", "Please get a new team invite");
      } else {
        throw new Fault(
          500,
          "Internal Server Error",
          "Please contact the software engineering team for assistance",
        );
      }
    });
  }
}, [teamID]);
```

The problem with using the useEffect Hook is that Server Components cannot use React Hooks. This forces us to use a Client Component, which makes us lose the benefits of server-side rendering. Additionally, calling an API instead of directly querying the database is slower, defeating the purpose of server-side rendering.

By replacing the useEffect with a database call directly in a Server Component and making the interactive parts of the pages into Client Components, we are able to optimize performance significantly. This approach leverages server-side rendering to fetch data closer to the source, reducing latency and ensuring that team information is readily available when the page loads.
