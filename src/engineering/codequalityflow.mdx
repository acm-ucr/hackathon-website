# ESLint, Prettier, and Husky

## What are these tools?

### 1. ESLint

ESLint is a powerful linting tool for JavaScript and JSX. It analyzes your code to identify and report patterns that might lead to errors, bugs, or maintainability issues. ESLint enforces coding standards and helps developers write consistent, high-quality code.

### 2. Prettier

Prettier is a code formatter designed to keep your codebase consistently formatted. It eliminates the need for endless debates over code style by automatically formatting code according to predefined rules. Prettier ensures a uniform appearance throughout the project, reducing merge conflicts while making the code more readable and maintainable.

### 3. Husky

Husky is a tool that facilitates the integration of Git hooks into your workflow. Git hooks are scripts that run automatically at different points in the Git lifecycle. Husky allows you to define hooks, ensuring that specific actions, such as committing or pushing code, trigger scripts to enforce code quality and formatting checks.

## Integration into Workflows

### ESLint and Prettier Integration in hackathon website

**Configuration**: We configured Configure ESLint with rules from google and next in a `.eslintrc.json` file. Similarly, we set up Prettier configurations in a `.prettierrc` file to define code formatting preferences.

**Plugins**:

- We utilized the following plugins:
  - `eslint-config-google`
  - `eslint-config-next`
  - `eslint-plugin-react`
  - `eslint-config-prettier`

**Scripts**:

- We used the following scripts for lining and formatting:
  - `"lint": "next lint"`
  - `"format": "npx prettier --write ."`

### Husky Integration

How we integrated Husky:

**Prevent Commits with Errors**: We configured a pre-commit Husky hook to run ESLint and Prettier before allowing commits, preventing code with errors or formatting issues from being committed.

## Why did we choose these tools?

1. **Code Consistency and Readability**:

   - **ESLint**: Enforces consistent coding standards, ensuring that all developers follow the same coding practices.
   - **Prettier**: Automatically formats code, eliminating debates over styling preferences and improving code readability while also reducing merge conflicts.

2. **Code Quality Assurance**:

   - **ESLint**: Identifies potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells early in the development process.
   - **Prettier**: Focuses on code formatting, reducing the likelihood of introducing formatting-related issues such as merge conflicts.

3. **Development Efficiency**:

   - **Prettier**: Automates the code formatting process, saving developers time and reducing the manual effort required for formatting.

4. **Git Workflow Enhancements**:
   - **Husky**: Enforces code quality and formatting checks before allowing commits or pushes, preventing low-quality code from entering the repository.

By integrating these tools, we established a robust development environment that promotes code consistency, quality, and collaboration. These tools became essential components of our workflow, contributing to the overall success of our project.
