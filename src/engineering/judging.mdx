# **Judging Service**

#### 21st July 2024 by Raidah Fairooz

## **Judging Hackathons**

Similar to most competitions, hackathons also require judges to provide teams with valuable feedback and fairly rank projects. Each hackathon organiation decides upon their own judges and the criterion for judging. Depending on the type and tracks of the competition, judges with varied interests and strengths are invited. UCR Hackathons usually have a diverse panel of judges mostly consisting of professors, alumnis, students and/or industry professionals. After hacking ends, every team presents their projects and judges consult on their final selections.

## **Pre Hackathon-Website Judging System**

UCR hackathons used to follow a common system for inviting, assigning and running the judging routine both for in person and online. Organizing committees invited judges and collected all necessary information via email. Due to the number of teams exceeding available judges, we had timed sessions/rounds(~8 minutes) to fairly run the process. Every registered team would be manually assigned to an avaliable judge per round until next rotation. In practice, however, this system caused significant operational delays and often times unfair project evaluations.

Cons:

\*Issues with judge info collection and verification via email

\*Added effort and time for organizers to manually assign judges

\*Bad coordination, rounds with some teams missing judges

\*Delayed hackathon closing, keeping participants for ~2-3 hours extra

## **Solution: The Online Judging Service**

Firstly, hackathon website created customized forms for judges to sign up that collects and stores all the necessary information for the admin. This highly increased efficiency and reduced possible errors in information for the hackathon committees.
Hackathon website then implemented an effective online judging service in place of the manual judging system. It is essentially the same routine with timed rounds but it streamlines the entire assignment process. First both teams and judges data is pulled by the service using api.

```jsx
const load = () => {
  api({
    method: "GET",
    url: "/api/judging",
  }).then(({ items }) => {
    setData(items.teams);
    setFilters(items.teams);
    setJudges(items.judges);

    if (items.judges.length === 0) {
      setPopup({
        title: "Insufficient Judges",
        text: "There are not enough judges to go around to each team. Please consider adding more judges via the judge dashboard. ",
        color: "green",
        visible: true,
      });
    }
  });
};
```

Then we can set a rotation value i.e. the number of rounds. Based on this value, the _generate()_ function assigns a table and initializes the set number of rounds for each team. Then we use a nested loop to assign a non repeating judge for each team within each round and increment the judge counter. If we run out of judges, then we reset and move on to the next round. Finally, we update the team data and reset rotations.

```jsx
const [input, setInput] = useState({
  rotations: "",
  input: "",
});
const [search, setSearch] = useState("");

const generate = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (
    input.rotations === "" ||
    isNaN(input.rotations) ||
    parseInt(input.rotations) < 1 ||
    parseInt(input.rotations) > 99
  ) {
    toaster("Please enter a valid integer value between 1 and 99", "error");
    return;
  }

  if (judges.length === 0) {
    setPopup({
      title: "Insufficient Judges",
      text: "There are not enough judges to go around to each team. Please consider adding more judges via the judge dashboard. ",
      color: "green",
      visible: true,
    });
    return;
  }

  const teams = [...data];

  // Reset Rounds
  teams.forEach((team, index) => {
    team.rounds = Array.from(Array(parseInt(input.rotations)), () => []);
    team.table = index + 1;
  });

  let judge = 0;
  let round = 0;

  // assign judges
  for (let j = 0; j < input.rotations; j += 1) {
    for (let i = 0; i < teams.length; i += 1) {
      if (round === parseInt(input.rotations)) continue;
      if (
        teams[i].rounds.some((judges) =>
          judges.some((individual) => individual.name === judges[judge].name),
        )
      )
        continue;
      if (judge < judges.length) {
        teams[i].rounds[round].push(judges[judge]);
        judge += 1;
      }
      if (judge === judges.length) {
        judge = 0;
        round += 1;
      }
    }
  }

  if (judges.length * input.rotations < teams.length) {
    setPopup({
      title: "Insufficient Judges",
      text: "There are not enough judges to go around to each team. Please consider adding more judges via the judge dashboard. ",
      color: "green",
      visible: true,
    });
  }

  setData(teams);

  api({
    method: "PUT",
    url: "/api/judging",
    body: { teams },
  }).then(() => toaster("Rounds Saved!", "success"));

  setInput({
    ...input,
    rotations: "",
  });
};
```

## **Results:**

Cutiehack'24 was the first hackathon to use this service. Starting from smoother operations to easier judge handling, it led to the event successfully finishing more than 30 minutes early. Then the subsequent hackathons like Rose Hack and Bear Hack saved significant time and energy during their judging events.
