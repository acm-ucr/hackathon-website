# Component Testing

#### 26th Febuary 2024 by Divyank Shah

[Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io) is testing framework built to easily integrate with web based applications to provide component and end-to-end testing.

As the hackathon websites grew in size and developers, it became harder to ensure ALL parts of the website continued to maintain proper functionality without excessive QA efforts.

Cypress was introduced to help automate these tests and provide instant feedback when changing foundational components that power many of the current components used throughtout the website.

## What is Component Testing?

Component testing is more similar to unit tests, where developers _mount_ components and check various functionalities, ensuring components maintain proper state, styles and function.

## Component Test Walkthrough

The below is an example of a component test to ensure a custom Input component used in admin pages works properly:

```js title="cypress/component/admin/input.js"
import Input from "@/components/dynamic/admin/Input";
import { useState } from "react";

describe("Input", () => {
  it("Typing...", () => {
    const Parent = () => {
      const [object, setObject] = useState({
        name: "",
      });
      return (
        <Input label="name" type="text" object={object} setObject={setObject} />
      );
    };

    cy.mount(<Parent />);
    cy.get('[data-cy="name-input"]').should("have.value", "");
    cy.get('[data-cy="name-input"]').type("John Doe");
    cy.get('[data-cy="name-input"]').should("have.value", "John Doe");
  });
});
```

The syntax takes heavy inspiration from [Jest](https://jestjs.io), another popular Javascript testing framework.

The overall idea remains the same, to ensure the component works as intended despite the hundreds of changes it may go through.

Breaking up the above test into smaller pieces, we can get a better sense of what a component test entails:

```jsx
describe("Input", () => {
  it("Typing...", () => {
    # mount a component and test
  });
});
```

The above describes a test suite called `Input` and a single test `Typing...` where we can begin to mount and test our component's various functionalities.

```jsx
const Parent = () => {
  const [object, setObject] = useState({
    name: "",
  });
  return (
    <Input label="name" type="text" object={object} setObject={setObject} />
  );
};
```

Due to the nature of our component structure, the input component itself is only responsible for rendering a given state. It does not track its own state, these are all provided by the parent component.

Cypress allows developers to create a mini-React environment to simulate React Hooks such as `useState` to ensure state variables update correctly.

Once the component is mounted, Cypress kicks in and provides a suite of functions to use to test the component:

```jsx
cy.mount(<Parent />);
cy.get('[data-cy="name-input"]').should("have.value", "");
cy.get('[data-cy="name-input"]').type("John Doe");
cy.get('[data-cy="name-input"]').should("have.value", "John Doe");
```

With the `cy` suite, we can target particular an input element in our HTML and check for particular values with `have.value` and simulate a user typing with `type`.

This successfully concludes a single test for a single component. This can then be repeated to ensure that every component has multiple tests checking various possible states of the component.

## Automating Component Testing with Github Actions

These tests are then automated with Github Actions using the following workflow:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/pull-request.yaml"
component_testing:
  # ... intialization steps ...

  - name: Run Cypress
    uses: cypress-io/github-action@v6
    with:
      component: true
      project: ./
      browser: chrome
      start: npm run start
      wait-on: "http://localhost:3000"
```

Luckily, Cypress provides a Github Action to simulate the proper environments to mount the components and easily test them.

This Github Workflow is run every time a pull request is made to ensure new code coming into the repo passes all component tests. As of Feburary 2024, there are approximately 55 component tests testing various parts of the admin and user portals.

## Benefits

Intially, our hackathon website did not have component testing, as it was deemed an unnecessary effort. However, as the repo grew in size and components were reused across multiple places, the demand for testing spiked.

Component testing allowed us to provide a first line of defense when making changes to ensure developers did not change expected behaviors unless explicitly desired in an enhancement issue.

Integrating component testing with Github Actions, allowed developers to focus more on core functionalities and worry less about breaking older pages and components.

Overall, component testing has saved developers countless hours on debugging and merging broken fixes.
