# Tailwind

#### 23rd March 2024 by Menthy Wu

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that makes the process of building responsive webistes faster and eaiser.

## Why Tailwind?

Unlike other traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation, which primarily rely on pre-designed components, Tailwind provides a set of low-level utility classes that you can apply directly to HTML elements to style them. So Tailwind is more flexible and you are able to use these small components to achieve anything you want.

## Developer Experience

Tailwind CSS streamlines the styling process by offering an extensive range of utility classes that apply specific styles directly to elements. This eliminates the need for developers to create custom CSS rules for every styling requirement in a separate file, leading to accelerated development and minimized code verbosity. Although inline CSS can serve the purpose of applying styles directly to a component, Tailwind CSS stands out by providing a vast array of utility classes that streamline the styling process. With Tailwind CSS, developers can style elements consistently and intuitively. Furthermore, IntelliSense support in code editors, comprehensive documentation, and an active community contribute to a positive developer experience.

## Dynamic Classes

Tailwind allows us write all the styles in `className`. The className attribute of the `<div>` element includes dynamic classes based on props passed to the Tag component. These classes are concatenated using template literals:

`${classes}`: This allows additional custom classes to be passed to the component dynamically.

`${color.background}` and `${color.text}`: These classes apply background and text colors dynamically based on the color prop passed to the component.

`${onClick && hover:cursor-pointer ${color.hover}}`: This conditionally applies hover styles (changing the cursor to a pointer) if an onClick function is provided and applies a hover color based on the color prop.

```js title="src/components/dynamic/admin/Tag.jsx"
const Tag = ({ color, text, onClick, classes, statuses }) => {
  return (
    <div
      data-cy={`${text}-tag`}
      className={`${classes} ${color.background} ${color.text} ${
        onClick && `hover:cursor-pointer ${color.hover}`
      } whitespace-nowrap px-2 py-0.5 rounded text-xs md:text-sm w-fit m-0`}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {isNaN(text) ? text : statuses[text]}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Tag;
```

## Custom Classes

While Tailwind provides an extensive library of predefined utility classes, it also offers the flexibility to customize classes in the tailwind.config.js file.

For example, Tailwind allows you to define your own color palette in the config file, ensuring consistency in our design across the project. Instead of manually inputting hexadecimal color codes, we can use semantic color names consistently. Centralizing color definitions in the Tailwind config also makes it easier to manage and update colors. If we want to change one color completely, we only need to modify it in one place—the config file—rather than searching through our codebase for every instance of that color.

```js title="tailwind.config.js"
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/data/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/utils/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        poppins: ["var(--font-poppins)"],
      },
      colors: {
        hackathon: {
          "blue-100": "#38A3A5",
          "blue-200": "#22577A",
          "green-100": "#E7F7E9",
          "green-200": "#80ED99",
          "green-300": "#57CC99",
          "green-400": "#3CB97A",
          "yellow-100": "#FFCF55",
          "gray-100": "#E7E7E7",
          "gray-200": "#9ea4af",
          "gray-300": "#525252",
          page: "#F5F5F5",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/typography")],
};
```

## Responsive Breakpoints

Tailwind CSS breakpoints are a crucial aspect of creating responsive designs. Tailwind provides a set of predefined breakpoints that we can use to apply different styles based on the screen size.

`text-sm`: This class sets the text size to small (sm) by default on all screen sizes.

`md:text-lg`: This class changes the text size to large (lg) starting from the medium screen breakpoint (md). On medium and larger screens, the text will appear larger due to this class.

```js
<p className="text-center text-sm md:text-lg  text-hackathon-blue-200 m-0">
  {message}
</p>
```

## Pseudo Classes

Each utility class in Tailwind can be conditionally applied by prefixing the class name with a modifier that specifies the targeted condition, like "hover", "focus", "active", "first", "last", "odd", "even"

`hover:!bg-hackathon-green-300`: This class applies the background color hackathon-green-300 when the `<div>` element is hovered over. The hover: prefix indicates that the class should be applied when the element is in the hover state.

`hover:!text-white`: This class applies white text color when the `<div>` element is hovered over. The hover: prefix indicates that the class should be applied when the element is in the hover state.

```js title="src/components/dynamic/admin/services/Dropdown.jsx"
<div
  data-cy={`dropdown-option-${index}`}
  className=" hover:!bg-hackathon-green-300 hover:!text-white bg-transparent overflow-hidden px-3 py-1 last:rounded-b-lg"
  key={index}
  onClick={() => {
    setOption(option);
    setShow(false);
  }}
>
  {option.name}
</div>
```
