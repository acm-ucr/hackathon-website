# Checkin

#### 1st July 2024 by Divyank Shah

## History

A QR Code checkin system was originally introduced in Rosehack 2023 in hopes to provide a more efficient checkin process
for participants. It was later implemented separately in Citrushack 2023 before being added into hackathon website for Cutiehack 2023
Before participants would be required to fill out their information on a Google Spreadsheet. They would
then be able to grab customized hackathon swag and merch. Although Google Sheets is a great solution, there are some issues.
Users are often forced into a single line causing long wait times and frustration between participants and organizers. In
addition, participants would need to reenter information that we already had via registration.

## QR Code Based Checkin

The QR code checkin system attempts to solve these struggles. Participants do not need to reenter any information as they
information is saved already in our database. Using the same database we can check the users in. In addition, it is much easier
to create multiple checkin lines to help reduce wait times. Overall, the new checkin system greatly improved wait times,
frustrations, and checkin complexities. Due to the modularity of the system, it could be applied to other hackathon events.
Another primary use case was meal times, where participants would checkin for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This would help
ensure that everyone got a serving before seconds were provided. On a higher level it also provided great analytics as
organizers can see attendance trends across various events and throughout the day of the hackathon.

## Implementations

### Security Features: Refreshing QR Codes

Many of the features within the custom QR code system were influenced by similar larger platforms such as TicketMaster.
TicketMaster utilizes their own barcode scanner system to checkin participants for a concert, sports game or simlilar event.
One of the biggest features is that the barcode must be live directly shown via the mobile app as a screenshot would not work.
In order to implement this, it would be difficult to measure if the current device is an authorized device and we wanted to ensure
that participants were not checking in for other particpants via screenshots. As a result, we placed a timestamp on the QR codes,
such that a new QR code is generated every 5 seconds. Despite a continously changing QR code, the admin portal would be able to validate
or invalidate QR codes and successfully check them in.

### Security Features: One Time Checkin

Once a participant was checked in for a particular event they could not check in again for that event. This was by design to prevent
participants from acting as 2 participants rather than 1.

### Availability

The process of checking in a partipant would update a document in our database. As a result, multiple organizers can open the scanner
and checkin multiple participants at the same time. Since the database handled multiple incoming calls, we did not need to engineer
any special solutions.
