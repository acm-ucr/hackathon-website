# Schedule

#### 6th June 2024 By Jonathan Trujillo

## What is it?

A schedule is essential for any hackathon as it provides a concise and organized plan of events. A well-structured schedule helps participants manage their time effectively and offers clear information about the hackathon's start and end times, workshops, meal breaks, and project submission deadlines. Additionally, it enables organizers to run the event smoothly, prevent overlaps, and ensure all necessary resources are available when needed.

## How did we implement it?

In its initial implementation, the schedule was a client component, but we eventually transitioned it to a server component with the Google Calendar API, allowing events to be loaded asynchronously.

The latest iteration uses React Server Components, creating a calendar wrapper that calls the API server-side and loads all the data.

```js title="src\components\admin\services\calendar\CalendarWrapper.jsx"
const CalendarEvents = async () => {
  const min = new Date(
    new Date().getTime() - 20 * 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
  ).toISOString();

  const max = new Date(
    new Date().getTime() + 20 * 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
  ).toISOString();

  const hackathon = await api({
    method: "GET",
    url: `https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CALENDAR}/events?key=${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY}&singleEvents=true&orderBy=startTime&timeMin=${min}&timeMax=${max}`,
  });

  const leads = await api({
    method: "GET",
    url: `https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_LEADS}/events?key=${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY}&singleEvents=true&orderBy=startTime&timeMin=${min}&timeMax=${max}`,
  });

  const hackathonItems = hackathon.items;
  const leadsItems = leads.items;

  const rawEvents = [...hackathonItems, ...leadsItems];

  rawEvents.forEach((item) => {
    item.start = new Date(item.start.dateTime);
    item.end = new Date(item.end.dateTime);
    const [category, assignee] = item.description
      .split("\n")[0]
      .split("#")
      .map((item) => item.trim())
      .filter((item) => item !== "");
    item.category = category;
    item.color = LABELS[item.category].background;
    item.assignee = assignee;
    item.hidden = false;
  });

  return (
    <div className="relative h-screen">
      <CalendarWrapper events={rawEvents} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default CalendarEvents;
```

The benefit of using Google Calendar is its seamless event updating, as organizers only need to update the Google Calendar, and these changes are immediately reflected in the schedule component.

it used to be client side
and now its server side
and u can also talk bout the dynamic side of things
and how since the schedule is always on gcal, its always updated
go deeper into implementation
this implementation was only possible cause of RSC

## Issues encountered

We encountered a minor timezone issue involving UTC and PST that was affecting our data parsing. Events occurring after 5-6pm PST were being misclassified due to the transition to a new day in UTC, prompting us to address the discrepancy. We resolved the issue by choosing a standard timezone approach and implementing it consistently, ensuring accurate event classification moving forward.
