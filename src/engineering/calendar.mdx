## What is React Big Calendar?

[React Big Calendar](https://github.com/jquense/react-big-calendar?tab=readme-ov-file) is a popular Javascript library used for building interactive and customizable event calendars in React applications for modern browsers (except Internet Explorer). It uses flexbox over the traditional tables-caption approach to provide a flexible and responsive interface for displaying events and schedules in various views such as month, week, day, and agenda.

Some key features of React Big Calendar include:

**Customizable views:** Switch between different calendar views like month, week, day, or agenda.

**Event customization:** Customize the appearance and behavior of events (i.e., colors, sizes, tooltips, and event titles).

**Localization:** Display calendar content in different languages and formats.

**Integration with data sources:** The calendar can be integrated with various data sources such as JSON, REST APIs, or local data arrays to dynamically populate events.

## Why is a Calendar Necessary?

Calendars are fundemantal organizational tools, particularly for managing events and schedules efficiently. This holds especially true for hacakthons, where administrators require precise scheduling and coordination. We wanted a centralized calendar that administrators could use to efficiently plan and manage these activites, avoiding scheduling conflicts and ensuring a smooth flow of events. By having a single source of truth for all scheduled activities, administrators can easily communicate updates and changes to participants, speakers, and volunteers, thereby facilitating optimal coordination and maximizing the overall productivity and success of the hackathon.

## Why did we pull from Google Calendar?

As a free and accessible tool to a broad audience, we can ensure that subsequent hacakthon administrators will be able to seamlessly create and manage events long after the initial development team completes the project. This accessibility streamlines the process of scheduling events, enabling administrators to coordinate effectively and ensure a smooth and well-organized hackathon experience.

## How is this implemented and customized?

The calendar component fetches events data from two different Google Calendar APIs, processes them, sets event states, and renders them using react-big-calendar.

```js title="src/components/dynamic/admin/services/calendar/Events.jsx"
useEffect(() => {
  const hackathon = api({
    method: "GET",
    url: `https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/...`,
  });

  Promise.all([hackathon, leads]).then(([hackathonData, leadsData]) => {
    const hackathonItems = hackathonData.items;
    const leadsItems = leadsData.items;
    const rawEvents = [...hackathonItems, ...leadsItems];

    rawEvents.forEach((item) => {
      item.start = new Date(item.start.dateTime);
      item.end = new Date(item.end.dateTime);
      const [category, assignee] = item.description
        .split("\n")[0]
        .split("#")
        .map((item) => item.trim())
        .filter((item) => item !== "");
      item.category = category;
      item.assignee = assignee;
      item.hidden = false;
    });

    setEvents(rawEvents);
  });

  document.addEventListener("keydown", handleShortcuts);
  return () => document.removeEventListener("keydown", handleShortcuts);
}, []);
```

The Toolbar component provides controls for navigating between views (month and week), changing the date range, and filtering events by various categories. It renders tags for different views, navigation buttons, and category filters.

```js title="src/components/dynamic/admin/services/calendar/Toolbar.jsx"
return (
  <div className="grid grid-cols-3">
    <div className="flex items-center">
      <Tag
        onClick={() => onView("month")}
        text="month"
        // Other props...
      />
      <Tag
        onClick={() => onView("week")}
        text="week"
        // Other props...
      />
    </div>
    {/* Navigation buttons */}
    <div className="flex justify-evenly items-center flex-wrap">
      {Object.entries(LABELS).map(([label, value], index) => (
        <Tag
          key={index}
          text={label}
          // Other props...
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

Overall, these factors combine to provide a flexible and interactive calendar component with features for viewing, navigating, and filtering events quickly and easily.
